        Ali was known for his incredible boxing skills, agility, and charisma both inside and outside the ring. He won the
        world heavyweight championship three times and became the first fighter to capture the title three times. Ali's
        fights against his rivals, such as Joe Frazier and George Foreman, are legendary and have become part of boxing
        history.

        Apart from his boxing career, Ali was also an influential civil rights activist and spoke out against racial
        inequality and injustice. He famously refused to be drafted into the military during the Vietnam War, citing his
        religious beliefs and opposition to the war. His activism and outspokenness made him an icon for many people around
        the world.
